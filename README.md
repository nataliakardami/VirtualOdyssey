### Introduction to Artificial Intelligence B, Radboud University

Virtual Odyssey is a text-based adventure where the player gets to decide how the story will unfold. In this story, the main character (the player), decides to play a game on their Virtual Reality Headset. Once the player wears the headset, they quickly realise that they cannot remove it, and subsequently trapped in this new reality. The game starts on a boat, where our hero tries to find a secret code that will help them escape from this world. In order to do that, they must visit various islands and encounter various friendly (or not so friendly) locals, who play a major role in the escape. Each island will help uncover a piece of the code and help the hero return to reality.
